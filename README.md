# Multiple Genome Alignment Pipeline
This project offers a simplified pathway for aligning multiple genome in various organisms. It is intended to be scalable, reproducible, and simplle to integrate into comparative genomics procedures.

## Features

- Multiple entire genomes are aligned [MAFFT/MUGSY/Mauve/etc.]
- It produce alignment file formats, such as fasta.
- Generates summary statistics (alignment score, conserved regions, gaps)
- Easily customizable and extendable
